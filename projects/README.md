*Setups*
    Installation:
        Create a virtual environment:
            to do so, run: python -m venv land_lend_venv

        Copy the land_lend folder into the virtual environment.
            to do so, run: cd land_lend land_lend_venv
        
        Install the requirements.
            to do so, run: pip install -r requirements.txt

    Setting environment variables:
    For setting up environment variables, check *_setups_* dir.
        Linux setups:
            Run the _source set-env.sh_ and _source unset-env.sh_ for cleaning up.
        
        Windows setups:
            Run the _source set-env.bat_ and _source unset-env.bat_ for cleaning up.
            Note: Windows setups are not tested by me.
